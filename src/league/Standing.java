/**
 * Represents the league standing for a football team.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Standing} class tracks all relevant statistics for a team in a league, including:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Points</li>
 *   <li>Wins</li>
 *   <li>Draws</li>
 *   <li>Losses</li>
 *   <li>Total matches played</li>
 *   <li>Goals scored</li>
 *   <li>Goals conceded</li>
 *   <li>The associated team</li>
 * </ul>
 * It also maintains initialization flags for each field to ensure data integrity and proper initialization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class implements the {@link IStanding} interface, making it compatible with the Football Manager API.
