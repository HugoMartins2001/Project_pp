/**
 * Implements a strategy for simulating football (soccer) matches.
 * <p>
 * The {@code MatchSimulatorStrat} class provides logic for simulating various match events,
 * such as red cards, injuries, and substitutions. It keeps track of affected players and
 * enforces rules such as the maximum number of substitutions allowed per team.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class implements the {@link MatchSimulatorStrategy} interface and uses a random number
 * generator to introduce stochastic elements into the simulation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Features</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Tracks players who receive red cards, are injured, or are substituted.</li>
 *   <li>Enforces a maximum of {@value #MAX_SUBSTITUTIONS} substitutions per team.</li>
 *   <li>Supports separate substitution counts for home and away teams.</li>
 *   <li>Utilizes a {@link Random} instance for event simulation.</li>
 * </ul>
